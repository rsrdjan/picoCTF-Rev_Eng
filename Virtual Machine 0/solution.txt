This one was a bit hard for me, because I didn't have a clue about 3D software or geometrical representation of objects.
You're provided with .dae file that represents 3D model with two axles. After I found out what are .dae files and installed
Blender (sudo apt install blender), I loaded the file and managed to zoom in to see the object that was some kind of
mechanical machine with two rotors - blue that is attached to blue exle and red one with red axle. By visually inspecting
the object, I noticed that blue rotor had 8 knobs (are they knobs? or how they are called... anyway...) and red one 40.
That means that when you turn one cycle with red axle, blue one turns 40 knobs, giving us 8:40 (5x) ratio.
We're provided with file input.txt that contains huge decimal number which is the input that should provide us with the
flag as output.
So, the formula is input.txt number * 5, and this result should be converted to hex representation in order to convert it
to ASCII:
0x7069636f4354467b67333472355f30665f6d3072335f64303563366436337d -> picoCTF{g34r5_0f_m0r3_d05c6d63}
It is kinda simple but you need to understand what is asked. Cheers.

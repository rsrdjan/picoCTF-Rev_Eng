In order to solve this challenge, you need to know the rules and theory of CoreWars game (I didn't, had to google it).
Solution that worked for me is to change the code of he Imp (imp.red) in MOV instruction (MOV 0, 1 -> MOV 1,1):

nc saturn.picoctf.net 65303 < imp.red 
;redcode
;name Imp Ex
;assert 1
mov 1, 1
end
Submit your warrior: (enter 'end' when done)

Warrior1:
;redcode
;name Imp Ex
;assert 1
mov 1, 1
end

Rounds: 100
Warrior 1 wins: 0
Warrior 2 wins: 100
Ties: 0
You did it!

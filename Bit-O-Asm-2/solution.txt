In assembly dump file there are following two instructions:

<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]

meaning we are storing DWORD value 0x9fe1a in the memory location pointed to by
[rbp-0x4] (instruction 1) and storing that value in eax register (instruction 2).

0x9fe1a in hex is 654874 in decimal:
picoCTF{654874}

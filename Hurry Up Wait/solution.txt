Although binary has a name "svchost.exe" it is actually an ELF binary file :)

After some analysis, I can see that this program is written in ADA language. Nevertheless, by following execution
flow, I saw that function FUN_0010298a is interesting because it contained calls to 28 different functions and returns.
First function just delays the execution for some time, but the rest of 27 with "FUN_" prefix are printing one
character at a time.

For example (global var DAT_00102ce8 stores the value 0x7Dh which is hex code for ASCII character '}'):

LEA RAX,[DAT_00102ce8]  (load effective address of memory location of DAT_00102ce8 and store it in RAX register)
...
CALL <EXTERNAL>::ada__text_io__put__4  (call print function)


When all charaters are printed:
picoCTF{d15a5m_ftw_eab78e4}

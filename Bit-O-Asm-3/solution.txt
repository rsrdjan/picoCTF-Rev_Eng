In assembly dump file there are following instructions:

<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
<+41>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
<+44>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]

This is what CPU executes:

<+15>:  DWORD value 654874 is stored in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0xc]
<+22>:  DWORD value 4 is stored in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0x8]
<+29>:  Value stored in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0xc[ (654874) is stored in eax register
<+32>:  Value stored in eax register is multiplied with value stored in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0x8] (4) and result is stored in eax register
<+36>:  Value 501 is added to the value stored in eax register and the result is stored in eax register
<+41>:  Value stored in eax register is stored in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0x4]
<+44>:  Value in memory location pointed to by [rbp-0x4] is stored in eax register

Hence, the flag is:
picoCTF{2619997}

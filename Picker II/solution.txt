When connecting to the host and trying to input 'win' you will see the 'illegal input'.
Why is that? It is because now we have new function filter() that checks if you entered
'win' and returns false if you did:

def filter(user_input):
  if 'win' in user_input:
    return False
  return True

Now, there is a hint: "Can you do what win does with your input to the program?"
Let see function win():

def win():
  # This line will not work locally unless you create your own 'flag.txt' in
  #   the same directory as this script
  flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()
  #flag = flag[:-1]
  flag = flag.strip()
  str_flag = ''
  for c in flag:
    str_flag += str(hex(ord(c))) + ' '
  print(str_flag)

Ok, so let's try to open and print file flag.txt:

==> print(open('flag.txt','r').read())
picoCTF{f1l73r5_f41l_c0d3_r3f4c70r_m1gh7_5ucc33d_0b5f1131}

Oh, we got it!
